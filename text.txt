The new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher [AES], which has more strength, needs stronger groups.  For the 128-bit AES we need about a 3200-bit group [Orman01].  The 192 and 256-bit keys would need groups that are about 8000 and 15400 bits respectively.  Another source [RSA13] [Rousseau00] estimates that the security equivalent key size for the 192-bit symmetric cipher is 2500 bits instead of 8000 bits, and the equivalent key size 256-bit symmetric cipher is 4200 bits instead of 15400 bits.
