You can lie to your buddies, but don't lie to yourself. It doesn't really matter that you were deceived buddy, just make a haha ​​and it's over. But I hope you wipe the corners of your eyes after typing this sentence, and don't let the tears fall on the phone screen. It's nothing to believe what you said, buddy. It can also give you a sense of comfort, but it's almost enough to lie to your brother by saying this, and we won't lose a piece of meat if we believe in you, but you don't need to take it seriously. It really doesn't matter if your buddy is deceived by you, and your brothers smiled and passed. It's not that the buddy wants to hurt your heart, you wipe your tears and think about it, who will believe what you say except the bros?​

骗哥们可以，别把你自己也骗到了就行。哥们被你骗了真无所谓的，打个哈哈就过了。但希望你打完这段话后擦一下眼角，别让眼泪掉在手机屏幕上了就行。你说的这些话，哥们信一下也是没什么的。还能让你有个心里安慰，但这种话说出来骗骗兄弟就差不多得了，哥们信你一下也不会少块肉，但是你别搞得自己也当真了就行。哥们被你骗一下是真无所谓的，兄弟笑笑也就过去了。真不是哥们想要破你防，你擦擦眼泪好好想想，除了兄弟谁还会信你这些话？​
